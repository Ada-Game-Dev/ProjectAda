Step 6: Define Routes and API Endpoints In the server.js file, define routes and API endpoints for handling HTTP requests and interacting with the MongoDB database using Mongoose.

Step 7: Set Up the Frontend Navigate into the client directory (created in Step 4) and start building your React frontend components.

Step 8: Connect Frontend and Backend Ensure that your frontend can make HTTP requests to your backend by setting up CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) in your Express.js backend.

Step 9: Set Up the Database Connection In your backend server, establish a connection to your MongoDB database using Mongoose.

Step 10: Start the Development Servers In one terminal, run the backend server using:

Copy codenode server.js 
In another terminal, navigate into the client directory and run the frontend React server using:

sqlCopy codenpm start 
Step 11: Test Your Application Visit http://localhost:3000 in your web browser to see your MERN stack application running. You can interact with your frontend React components, and they will communicate with the backend server to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on the MongoDB database.

Keep in mind that this is a basic setup guide, and as you develop your MERN stack application, you'll likely want to implement more features, set up user authentication, and deploy the application to a production server.
